# **Volumetric Interaction**

![Image](Images/VI-combined.gif)

This project involves developing a dynamic volumetric (3D) texture rendering implementation to
assess the viability of dynamic volumetric textures in games. The viability will be gauged by
performance benchmarks across multiple devices.

By using dynamic volumetric textures for environment interaction, multiple shortcomings of
traditional approaches can be subverted, resulting in more immersive virtual environments.

### Abstract
This paper presents a prototype system for generating dynamic volume textures for reactive shaders and assesses its performance on hardware of varying capabilities to conclude the viability of dynamic volume textures in games.
